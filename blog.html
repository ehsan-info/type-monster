            <h1>Difference between Local Storage and Session Storage</h1>
            <p>Session Storage is available for the duration of the page session. It maintains a separate storage area
                for each given origin. This will be removed when the page or browser is closed, reopen and restores. It
                is session based so we dont need to delete it manually. It will be deleted when the browser is closed.
            </p>

            <p>Local Storage is also like session storage. It does the same thing, but the storage data persists even
                when the browser is closed and reopened. This is not session based so we need to delete it via
                javascript or manually</p>
            <h1>Global Scope vs Block Scope</h1>
            <p>Globar Scope contains all of the things outside of all the code blocks. Code blocks simply means a group
                of statement that is surrouned by curly braces ({ }). We can use this variable anywhere in the code
                section.</p>
            <p>Local Scope refers the variable that contain inside all of the code blocks. Local variable has local
                scope. So it is only accessible where it is declared. Outside that code blocks we can not access those
                variable.</p>
            <h1>How does Event Loop work?</h1>
            <p>The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack
                is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack,
                which effectively runs it.</p>
            <p>The Event Loops does one simple job. It monitors the Callback Queue and Call Stack. When it sees Call
                Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue. And then it will push to Call
                Stack.</p>
            <h1>How many ways are there to find 'Undefined' output?</h1>
            <p>There are many ways we can get Undefined as output. Some are given below:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Varibale that is not initialised will give undefined</li>
                <li>Function with no return provide undefined</li>
                <li>Parameter that is passed which is not in the function will provide undefined</li>
                <li>If return has nothing in right side will provide undefined</li>
                <li>If object doenst have the property to display or doesnt exits in the object then it will show
                    undefined</li>
                <li>Accessing array elements outside of the index range will provide undefined</li>
                <li>Deleting an element from an array</li>
                <li>If we assign undefined as value then it will provide undefined</li>
            </ul>
